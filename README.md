## This project is brain-games, it includes 5 mathematical games: brain-even, brain-calc, brain-gcd, brain-progression and brain-prime.

### For win in the game user must to give three rigth answers in a row, otherwise the game will be over, and it can be restarting.

Brain-even: to user shown a random number, and user need to answer 'yes' if the number is even, otherwise answer 'no'.

Brain-calc: to user shown a random mathematical expression, and user need to calculate it and write rigth answer.

Brain-gcd: to user shown two random numbers, and user need to calculate and write the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

Brain-progression: to user shown a row of numbers, that is arithmetic progression. But one number is hidden by two dots. User need to write the hidden number.

Brain-prime: to user shown a random number, and user need to answer "yes" if given number is prime. Otherwise answer "no".

For start playing to the brain-games, you need to clone this repository on your local computer, to open command line interface, change directory to /frontend-project-44/, to input 'make install' that will install all dependences of programm. And after that any game can be launched by its name. For example: brain-calc.

**Version requirements:**
node v18.12.1,
make v4.3,
readline-sync v1.4.10,
ESLint v8.30.0.
